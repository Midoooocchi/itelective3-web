## About the System
The main system for this project is the Order system which contains three sub-systems: Inventory system, Credit system and Order history. The purpose of this system is to enable the customers to check the seller's inventory and their transaction and order item status. On the other hand, the service representatives can maintain customers to ensure everything goes well between the customers and the business. They also have the authorization to return items and check the business' inventory, customer transaction details, and order status. The system will also ensure that both customers and service representatives have a smooth process of ordering and returning items.
